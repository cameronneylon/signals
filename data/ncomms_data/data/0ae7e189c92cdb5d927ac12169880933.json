Here, we report both the new analytical model and experimental demonstration of the photon sieves with ultrahigh-capacity of subwavelength holes (over 34 thousands) arranged in two different structural orders of randomness and aperiodicity. The random photon sieve produces a uniform optical hologram with high diffraction efficiency and free from twin images that are usually seen in conventional holography, while the aperiodic photon sieve manifests sub-diffraction-limit focusing in air. A hybrid approach is developed to make the design of random and aperiodic photon sieve viable for high-accuracy control of the amplitude, phase and polarization of visible light. The polarization independence of the photon sieve will also greatly benefit its applications in optical imaging and spectroscopy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Kun Huang","Kun Huang","Hong Liu","Francisco J.
