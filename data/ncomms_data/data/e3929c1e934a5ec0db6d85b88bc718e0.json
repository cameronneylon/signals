However, for periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) reconnection is less likely at the dayside magnetopause, and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves (KHWs) may be important agents for plasma entry and for the excitation of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves. The relative importance of KHWs is controversial because no statistical data on their occurrence frequency exist. Here we survey 7 years of in situ data from the NASA THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macro scale Interactions during Substorms) mission and find that KHWs occur at the magnetopause ∼19% of the time. The rate increases with solar wind speed, Alfven Mach number and number density, but is mostly independent of IMF magnitude. KHWs may thus be more important for plasma transport across the magnetopause than previously thought, and frequently drive magnetospheric ULF waves.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Shiva Kavosi","Joachim Raeder","Kavosi, Shiva","Raeder, Joachim"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8019","first_seen_on":"2015-05-11T17:29:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150511/ncomms8019/full/ncomms8019.html","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms8019","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8019","http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8019.epdf?shared_access_token=PDDujEWUZhlEl5r6PjWjBtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MdTW4rCGE-b6qAA95w6ryo0LFmRuqhlB_TKjvCxqSaU87Cf8mHA0EqDZLMZ4ChRxa-spFOr_SP1W0AHYMy6KG2zt9Dty0ez-PVWUk7Id4LVdHhZrDzDlXZ-c240nkh0NQ%3D"],"pmid":"25960122","pubdate":"2015-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Ubiquity of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves at Earth/'s magnetopause","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/ubiquity-kelvinhelmholtz-waves-earths-magnetopause"},"altmetric_score":{"score":156.872,"score_history":{"1y":105,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":156.872},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281486,"mean":6.2131255898695,"rank":23851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5257662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281486,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164492,"mean":9.3660936343023,"rank":1369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":163123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164492,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8732,"mean":34.96196266178,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8732,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":29.571411931818,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
