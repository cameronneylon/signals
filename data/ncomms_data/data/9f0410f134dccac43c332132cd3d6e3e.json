Here we report that HIV-1 Rev causes specific degradation of cytoplasmic Tat, which results in inhibition of HIV-1 replication. The nuclear export signal (NES) region of Rev is crucial for this activity but is not involved in direct interactions with Tat. Rev reduces the levels of ubiquitinated forms of Tat, which have previously been reported to be important for its transcriptional properties. Tat is stabilized in the presence of\nquinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and potent degradation of Tat is induced by dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor. Furthermore, Rev causes specific reduction in the levels of endogenous NQO1. Thus, we propose that Rev is able to induce degradation of Tat indirectly by downregulating NQO1 levels. Our findings have implications in HIV-1 gene expression and latency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Sneh Lata","Amjad Ali","Vikas Sood","Rameez Raja","Akhil C.
