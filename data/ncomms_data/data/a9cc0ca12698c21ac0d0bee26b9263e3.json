Here we show that desert soils accumulate metal superoxides and peroxides at higher levels than non-desert soils. We also show the photogeneration of equimolar superoxide and hydroxyl radical in desiccated and aqueous soils, respectively, by a photo-induced electron transfer mechanism supported by their mineralogical composition. Reactivity of desert soils is further supported by the generation of hydroxyl radical via aqueous extracts in the dark. Our findings extend to desert soils the photogeneration of reactive oxygen species by certain mineral oxides and also explain previous studies on desert soil organic oxidant chemistry and microbiology. Similar processes driven by ultraviolet radiation may be operating in the surface soils on Mars.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Georgiou, Christos D","Sun, Henry J","McKay, Christopher P","Grintzalis, Konstantinos","Papapostolou, Ioannis","Zisimopoulos, Dimitrios","Panagiotidis, Konstantinos","Zhang, Gaosen","Koutsopoulou, Eleni","Christidis, George E","Margiolaki, Irene"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8100","first_seen_on":"2015-05-11T10:40:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8100.epdf?shared_access_token=g45KQfxsGWEuttqcq8l9wdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NPZgwBi6LUk3Kq4SxlA2uApCO76sCtLgCKaxR7kdGDX-PUAJzStYR7HIzdJwkNuwoxjAKXoTRtr4twbPAwbghrTFDw4Gyb9N6l_JUaKIBfIvZ7xb5QiyyeBsph4PptFtcuxemunPInth2DZteCcj45q-x00HX8lMkixtFETRyQ9A%3D%3D","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8100"],"pmid":"25960012","pubdate":"2015-05-12T22:02:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Evidence for photochemical production of reactive oxygen species in desert soils","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/evidence-photochemical-production-reactive-oxygen-species-desert-soils-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5361876,"mean":6.2737966614312,"rank":1096529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4257798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5361876,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165378,"mean":9.387726842306,"rank":45158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":119957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165378,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8898,"mean":35.585518264584,"rank":5227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":3653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8898,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":29.882599431818,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Ph.
