properties, has offered unprecedented prospects for developing flat two-dimensional displaying systems. Here, we show that reduced graphene oxide enabled write-once holograms for wide-angle and full-colour three-dimensional images. This is achieved through the discovery of subwavelength-scale multilevel optical index modulation of athermally reduced graphene oxides by a single femtosecond pulsed beam. This new feature allows for static three-dimensional holographic images with a wide viewing angle up to 52 degrees. In addition, the spectrally flat optical index modulation in reduced graphene oxides enables wavelength-multiplexed holograms for full-colour images. The large and polarization-insensitive phase modulation over π in reduced graphene oxide composites enables to restore vectorial wavefronts of polarization discernible images through the vectorial diffraction of a reconstruction beam. Therefore, our technique can be leveraged to achieve compact and versatile holographic components for controlling light.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Xiangping Li","Xiangping Li","Haoran Ren","Xi Chen","Juan Liu","Qin Li","Chengmingyue Li","Gaolei Xue","Jia Jia","Liangcai Cao","Amit Sahu","Bin Hu","Yongtian Wang","Guofan Jin","Min Gu"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7984","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T08:10:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7984","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms7984","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/pdf/ncomms7984.pdf","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html#ref4","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html#affil-auth","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html?WT.mc_id=GOP_NatureComms_1504_HOLOGRAPHIC_OR","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms7984.epdf?shared_access_token=80OBoq6UTv_QFlL0Y4i4V9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P97ee-jPogdaHP6xWFQxOnPw_q0OL7iCi_KUJ2AsSxQKFiX_n_zWX9xSvZcp_Hr_CoBw3y7z1GKi7cOUh5BOFTtZ5uDrn55TmvaFz1Dj4BrEn4T7e_aXDyJjziBVu7MrzVmRmpthmagCTdj9xVS62NiW3vHm2S_Imt-lTnIJ-1Xgo_2j4sNZFRUr1S352bbfA%3D","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms7984.epdf?shared_access_token=M6ymzLcAadz6W6wI2prVGdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P97ee-jPogdaHP6xWFQxOnPw_q0OL7iCi_KUJ2AsSxQG7a-gMe3VaxEqkv1mf8-d68scUkFCP4Gi6f2P1p30y64hZuhCCtuYy04k38LudY_WkPYjXZfDl9w8dsYzwGUgyg2wEjkl98K1TSLBch50oiqAkuZ8fAOL1eB3TPF4pgalwGy2oYhlfesY7IM0ziWuM%3D","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms7984.epdf?shared_access_token=AChzKQeD3A7uMab9aX16KtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P97ee-jPogdaHP6xWFQxOnPw_q0OL7iCi_KUJ2AsSxQG7a-gMe3VaxEqkv1mf8-d68scUkFCP4Gi6f2P1p30y64hZuhCCtuYy04k38LudY_WkPYjXZfDl9w8dsYzwGUgyg2wEjkl98K1TSLBch50oijsp6bP-yqIp9y75tF0sHkJ9x3pONhSxjB_TPVZEq4RA%3D","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html#supplementary-information","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html?WT.mc_id=FBK_NatureComms_1504_HOLOGRAPHIC_OR","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms7984.epdf?shared_access_token=S-sDlf38f_J3eA792KQd8NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P97ee-jPogdaHP6xWFQxOnPw_q0OL7iCi_KUJ2AsSxQJAktpbLQ_veuHuS4u7ptYkqKiRT_DpVCVsmnNuhmHVfnYCoR9N_1wI64HkG1GFhCGZBYCE0BDYlq6xVxU8zSf3Y2QmD_raQegptL0uF2bkK142YZfLxZrgSNi3hEaUoDQ%3D%3D"],"pmid":"25901676","pubdate":"2015-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Athermally photoreduced graphene oxides for three-dimensional holographic images","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/athermally-photoreduced-graphene-oxides-threedimensional-holographic-images"},"altmetric_score":{"score":181.726,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":181.726},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5320841,"mean":6.2377212094336,"rank":19503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5301338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5320841,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160879,"mean":9.8273509864619,"rank":1182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":159697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160879,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8818,"mean":35.232997845072,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8818,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":31.814280811232,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":28,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":28,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Researcher":6,"Other":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Master":13,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
