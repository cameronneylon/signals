Among these, Th17 cells play a prominent role in the development of a number of autoimmune diseases. Although regarded primarily as an immunosuppressant signal, cAMP has been found to mediate pro-inflammatory effects of macrophage-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on Th17 cells. Here we show that PGE2 enhances Th17 cell differentiation via the activation of the CREB co-activator CRTC2. Following its dephosphorylation, CRTC2 stimulates the expression of the cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F by binding to CREB over both promoters. CRTC2-mutant mice have decreased Th17 cell numbers, and they are protected from experimental autoimmune encephalitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. Our results suggest that small molecule inhibitors of CRTC2 may provide therapeutic benefit to individuals with autoimmune disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Hernandez, Jeniffer B","Chang, Christina","LeBlanc, Mathias","Grimm, David","Le Lay, John","Kaestner, Klaus H","Zheng, Ye","Montminy, Marc"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8216","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T15:33:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26031354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150602/ncomms8216/full/ncomms8216.html"],"pmid":"26031354","pubdate":"2015-06-03T22:05:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"The CREB/CRTC2 pathway modulates autoimmune disease by promoting Th17 differentiation","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/crebcrtc2-pathway-modulates-autoimmune-disease-promoting-th17-differentiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325307,"mean":6.2415772840095,"rank":2827751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1807470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325307,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177474,"mean":8.8637736444419,"rank":100065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":60154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177474,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8826,"mean":35.276221869688,"rank":7104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8826,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":32.791093877551,"rank":601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":3,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
