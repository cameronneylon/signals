compared to conventional pigmentation based display technologies, such as increased resolution and scalability of their optical response with structure dimensions. However, once these structures are fabricated their optical characteristics remain static, limiting their potential application. Here, by using a specially designed nanostructured plasmonic surface in conjunction with high birefringence liquid crystals, we demonstrate a tunable polarization-independent reflective surface where the colour of the surface is changed as a function of applied voltage. A large range of colour tunability is achieved over previous reports by utilizing an engineered surface which allows full liquid crystal reorientation while maximizing the overlap between plasmonic fields and liquid crystal. In combination with imprinted structures of varying periods, a full range of colours spanning the entire visible spectrum is achieved, paving the way towards dynamic pixels for reflective displays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Daniel Franklin","Yuan Chen","Abraham Vazquez-Guardado","Sushrut Modak","Javaneh Boroumand","Daming Xu","Shin-Tson Wu","Debashis Chanda","Franklin, Daniel","Chen, Yuan","Vazquez-Guardado, Abraham","Modak, Sushrut","Boroumand, Javaneh","Xu, Daming","Wu, Shin-Tson","Chanda, Debashis"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8337","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T12:15:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150611/ncomms8337/pdf/ncomms8337.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8337","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms8337","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150611/ncomms8337/full/ncomms8337.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150611/ncomms8337/full/ncomms8337.html#results","http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8337.epdf?shared_access_token=uxflLAmIscl47AQtl6rtBtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M_29V4YoBJQ6QLm0-0O72WbewLAf4Ti-wPO7WB_QAV46RqRFyFLC6mXwwAHbuEcfbbvh3cflXHCASEA4zXk3O0IPY4_ksHPpKl7K0H64bYOABB3BnXqkAlDpb20sDDVQPq6gYEj_2CXMPgcv3lRyIB"],"pmid":"26066375","pubdate":"2015-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Polarization-independent actively tunable colour generation on imprinted plasmonic surfaces","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/polarizationindependent-actively-tunable-colour-generation-imprinted-plasmonic-surfaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.968,"score_history":{"1y":34.968,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.968},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5137613,"mean":6.0774853371559,"rank":140330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":4997303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5137613,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181979,"mean":8.4800451922762,"rank":7977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":174002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181979,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8408,"mean":34.264878077792,"rank":2143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8408,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":706,"mean":32.365469503546,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":706,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":2,"Student  > Bachelor":6,"Researcher":17,"Other":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Ph.
