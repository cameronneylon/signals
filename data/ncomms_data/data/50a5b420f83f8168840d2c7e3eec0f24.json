It was previously suggested that inhibition of return is a foraging facilitator in visual search. Inhibition of return was first discovered in humans and was demonstrated also in monkeys, yet it has never been demonstrated in non-primates. Here we report the presence of inhibition of return in the archer fish, which shoots down prey on overhanging vegetation, using squirts of water spouted from its mouth. Moreover, we find similar attentional effects for fish as for human participants. Our results show that the generation of inhibition of return does not require a fully developed cortex and strengthen the view that inhibition of return functions as a foraging facilitator.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Shai Gabay","Tali Leibovich","Avi Ben-Simon","Avishai Henik","Ronen Segev"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms2644","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T08:02:07+00:00","issns":["2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n4/fig_tab/ncomms2644_F2.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms2644"],"pmid":"23552072","pubdate":"2013-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1657","title":"Inhibition of return in the archer fish","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/inhibition-return-archer-fish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5393826,"mean":6.2956146819752,"rank":1161680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4198761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5393826,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95728,"mean":6.999158983359,"rank":21892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":73397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95728,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8959,"mean":35.655914043313,"rank":5392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":3527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8959,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287,"mean":23.114643356643,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Lecturer":2,"Student  > Bachelor":7,"Researcher":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
