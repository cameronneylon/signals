Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe the transition to the insulator for a wide quantum well sample that can support single-layer or bilayer states depending on its overall carrier density. We find that the insulator exhibits a resonance which is characteristic of a bilayer solid. The resonance also reveals a pair of transitions within the solid, which are not accessible to dc transport measurements. As density is biased deeper into the bilayer solid regime, the resonance grows in specific intensity, and the transitions within the insulator disappear. These behaviours are suggestive of a picture of the insulating phase as an emulsion of liquid and solid components.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","arxiv_id":"1411.4060","authors":["A.
