However, owing to the lack of experimental information, knowledge is rare about interconversions of NSIs of gaseous molecules with torsional symmetry. Here we report our separation and conversion observations on NSI-torsion-specific transition systems of gaseous methanol from a light-induced drift experiment involving partially spatial separation of the ortho and para isomers. We find that vibrationally excited molecules of the methanol spin isomer have a smaller collision cross-section than their ground-state counterparts. Interconversion of the enriched ortho isomer with the para isomer, which is generally considered improbable, has been quantitatively studied by sensitive detections of the spectral intensities. Rather counterintuitively, this reveals that the interconversion is inhibited with increasing pressure. Our results suggest that the spin conversion mechanism in methanol is via a quantum relaxation process with the quantum Zeno effect induced by molecular collisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Zhen-Dong Sun","Meihua Ge","Yujun Zheng"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7877","first_seen_on":"2015-04-16T20:56:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150416/ncomms7877/pdf/ncomms7877.pdf","http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms7877"],"pmid":"25880882","pubdate":"2015-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Separation and conversion dynamics of nuclear-spin isomers of gaseous methanol","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/separation-conversion-dynamics-nuclearspin-isomers-gaseous-methanol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5020914,"mean":5.9476704575473,"rank":2314848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2578913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5020914,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144706,"mean":10.220883563111,"rank":71459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":68344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144706,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8147,"mean":33.577372943776,"rank":6011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8147,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":651,"mean":33.914815384615,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":651,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Assistant Professor":1,"Post Doc":1,"Ph.D. Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Astronomy / Astrophysics / Space Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https://twitter.com/Kochi_Study/status/588888406790307840","posted_on":"2015-04-17T02:15:11+00:00","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3915149],"author":{"name":"高知で学ぶ","url":"http://kochistudy.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1083504068/Kochi_Study_normal.png","description":"高知の教育・学習に関する情報を発信していきます。自学自習、学校教育、生涯学習、そして、生活・仕事に役立つ資格試験の情報を発信します。\r\n運用方針は、プロフィールのリンクでご確認下さい。","id_on_source":"Kochi_Study","geo":{"lt":33.55972,"ln":133.53111,"country":"JP"},"followers":1716},"tweet_id":"588888406790307840"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/Ritabril/status/588807985297760257","posted_on":"2015-04-16T20:55:37+00:00","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3915149],"author":{"name":"Rita Abril","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/722928819041103872/IgA857dz_normal.jpg","description":"#physics #chemistry #maths #chess #running #music #ballet #coffee ♡ Chemical Engineer.
