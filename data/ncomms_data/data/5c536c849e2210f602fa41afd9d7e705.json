Here we use recombinant NiVs (rNiVs) to examine the contributions of the NiV V and W proteins to NiV pathogenesis in a ferret model. We show that a V-deficient rNiV is susceptible to the innate immune response in vitro and behaves as a replicating non-lethal virus in vivo. Remarkably, rNiV lacking W expression results in a delayed and altered disease course with decreased respiratory disease and increased terminal neurological disease associated with altered in vitro inflammatory cytokine production. This study confirms the V protein as the major determinant of pathogenesis, also being the first in vivo study to show that the W protein modulates the inflammatory host immune response in a manner that determines the disease course.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Satterfield, Benjamin A","Cross, Robert W","Fenton, Karla A","Agans, Krystle N","Basler, Christopher F","Geisbert, Thomas W","Mire, Chad E"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8483","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T12:58:08+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26105519?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26105519","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:03:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"The immunomodulating V and W proteins of Nipah virus determine disease course.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/immunomodulating-v-w-proteins-nipah-virus-determine-disease-course"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5320841,"mean":6.2377212094336,"rank":4430396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5320841,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187018,"mean":8.4755158301119,"rank":151014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187018,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8818,"mean":35.232997845072,"rank":8434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8818,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":732,"mean":32.264664842681,"rank":703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":732,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Ph.
