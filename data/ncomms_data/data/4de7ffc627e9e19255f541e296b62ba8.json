standard remediation protocols having little effect. Nevertheless, reading improves if readers are induced to read faster. Here we show that this improvement can be enhanced by training. Training follows a multi-session procedure adapted to silent sentence reading, with individually set, increasingly more demanding, time constraints (letter-by-letter masking). In both typical and dyslexic adult readers, reading times are shortened and comprehension improves. After training, the dyslexic readers' performance is similar to that of typical readers; moreover, their connected text reading times and comprehension scores significantly improve in standard reading tests and are retained at 6 months post training. Identical training without time constraints proves ineffective. Our results suggest that fluent reading depends in part on rapid information processing, which then might affect perception, cognitive processing and possibly eye movements. These processes remain malleable in adulthood, even in individuals with developmental dyslexia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Zvia Breznitz","Shelley Shaul","Tzipi Horowitz-Kraus","Itamar Sela","Michael Nevat","Avi Karni"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms2488","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-02-12T16:51:41+00:00","issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733",""],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n2/full/ncomms2488.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n2/abs/ncomms2488.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n2/pdf/ncomms2488.pdf"],"pmid":"23403586","pubdate":"2013-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1486","subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Enhanced reading by training with imposed time constraint in typical and dyslexic adults","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/enhanced-reading-training-imposed-time-constraint-typical-dyslexic-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":37.244,"score_history":{"1y":7.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":37.244},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325928,"mean":6.2411004713384,"rank":140548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":5185565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325928,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292823,"mean":6.4184180150401,"rank":9058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":283765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292823,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8826,"mean":35.249264362606,"rank":2223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8826,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277,"mean":21.984898550725,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Members of the public":11,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Researcher":7,"Other":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Master":8,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Ph.
