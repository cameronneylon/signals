Chloroplasts contain a complex proteome, the biogenesis of which includes post-translational import of nuclear-encoded proteins. However, the mechanisms determining when and how nascent chloroplast-targeted proteins are sorted in the cytosol are unknown. Here, we establish the timing and mode of interaction between ankyrin repeat-containing protein 2 (AKR2A), the cytosolic targeting factor of chloroplast outer membrane (COM) proteins, and its interacting partners during translation at the single-molecule level. The targeting signal of a nascent AKR2A client protein residing in the ribosomal exit tunnel induces AKR2A binding to ribosomal RPL23A. Subsequently, RPL23A-bound AKR2A binds to the targeting signal when it becomes exposed from ribosomes. Failure of AKR2A binding to RPL23A in planta severely disrupts protein targeting to the COM; thus, AKR2A-mediated targeting of COM proteins is coupled to their translation, which in turn is crucial for biogenesis of the entire chloroplast proteome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Dae Heon Kim","Jae-Eun Lee","Zheng-Yi Xu","Kyoung Rok Geem","Yun Kwon","Joon Won Park","Inhwan Hwang"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7843","first_seen_on":"2015-04-21T13:58:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150416/ncomms7843/full/ncomms7843.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25880450","pubdate":"2015-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Cytosolic targeting factor AKR2A captures chloroplast outer membrane-localized client proteins at the ribosome during translation.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/cytosolic-targeting-factor-akr2a-captures-chloroplast-outer-membranelocalized-client-proteins-riboso"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5427448,"mean":6.3197803998823,"rank":2251467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3088386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5427448,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161447,"mean":9.8786597871736,"rank":68728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":89495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161447,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9027,"mean":35.925577886107,"rank":6345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9027,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":644,"mean":32.051104199067,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":644,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
