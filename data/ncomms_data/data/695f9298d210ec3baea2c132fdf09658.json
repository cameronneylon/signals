have critical roles in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Here we show that caspase-2 is required for the cognitive decline seen in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (J20). The age-related changes in behaviour and dendritic spine density observed in these mice are absent when they lack caspase-2, in spite of similar levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and inflammation. A similar degree of protection is observed in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking caspase-2, which are immune to the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ. Our studies suggest that caspase-2 is a critical mediator in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK-II signalling pathway, leading to the collapse of dendritic spines. We propose that this is controlled by an inactive caspase-2/RhoA/ROCK-II complex localized in dendrites, which dissociates in the presence of Aβ, allowing for their activation and entry in the spine. These findings directly implicate caspase-2 as key driver of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and offer novel therapeutic targets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Pozueta J","Lefort R","Ribe EM","Troy CM","Arancio O","Shelanski M"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms2927","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T19:07:31+00:00","issns":["","2041-1733"],"issue":"","journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23748737","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms2927"],"pmid":"23748737","pubdate":"2013-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Caspase-2 is required for dendritic spine and behavioural alterations in J20 APP transgenic mice","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/caspase2-required-dendritic-spine-behavioural-alterations-j20-app-transgenic-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":58.146,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":58.146},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685046,"mean":4.9228975163162,"rank":41013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":3644032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685046,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85745,"mean":7.1760164209741,"rank":1994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":83751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85745,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5277,"mean":25.240785064443,"rank":675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5277,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":23.540347826087,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Researcher":19,"Other":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Master":6,"Professor":3,"Student  > Ph.
