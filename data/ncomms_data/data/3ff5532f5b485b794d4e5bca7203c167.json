for the induction of proliferation. Activated ERK1/2 molecules that remain in the cytoplasm initiate other activities, including immediate feedback loops. Prevention of the nuclear translocation should therefore inhibit proliferation, without affecting cytoplasm-induced cellular processes. Here we present an NTS-derived myristoylated phosphomimetic peptide, which blocks the interaction of importin7 and ERK1/2, and consequently the nuclear translocation of the latter. In culture, the peptide induces apoptosis of melanoma cells inhibits the viability of other cancer cells, but has no effect on non-transformed, immortalized cells. It even inhibits the viability of PLX4032- and U0126-resistant melanoma cells. In xenograft models, the peptide inhibits several cancers, and acts much better than PLX4032 in preventing melanoma recurrence. This study provides a proof of concept for using the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 as a drug target for the combat of various ERK1/2-related cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Alexander Plotnikov","Alexander Plotnikov","Karen Flores","Galia Maik-Rachline","Eldar Zehorai","Einat Kapri-Pardes","Denise A.
