Here we show that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), a liver-enriched nuclear hormone receptor, is markedly inhibited, whereas miR-34a is highly induced in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, diabetic mice and mice fed a high-fat diet. miR-34a is essential for HNF4α expression and regulates triglyceride accumulation in human and murine hepatocytes. miR-34a inhibits very low-density lipoprotein secretion and promotes liver steatosis and hypolipidemia in an HNF4α-dependent manner. As a result, increased miR-34a or reduced HNF4α expression in the liver attenuates the development of atherosclerosis in Apoe(-/-) or Ldlr(-/-) mice. These data indicate that the miR-34a-HNF4α pathway is activated under common conditions of metabolic stress and may have a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and in regulating plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Targeting this pathway may represent a novel approach for the treatment of NAFLD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Yang Xu","Munaf Zalzala","Jiesi Xu","Yuanyuan Li","Liya Yin","Yanqiao Zhang","Xu, Yang","Zalzala, Munaf","Xu, Jiesi","Li, Yuanyuan","Yin, Liya","Zhang, Yanqiao"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8466","first_seen_on":"2015-06-24T07:37:34+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","phs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150623/ncomms8466/full/ncomms8466.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100857?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26100857","pubdate":"2015-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"A metabolic stress-inducible miR-34a-HNF4[alpha] pathway regulates lipid and lipoprotein metabolism","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/metabolic-stressinducible-mir34ahnf4%CE%B1-pathway-regulates-lipid-lipoprotein-metabolism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325307,"mean":6.2415772840095,"rank":3749231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":891432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325307,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186829,"mean":8.4923512749696,"rank":130495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186829,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8826,"mean":35.276221869688,"rank":7868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8826,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":732,"mean":32.260287277702,"rank":662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":732,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
