Because of a combination of factors such as habitat destruction, emerging pathogens and pollutants, over 156 amphibian species have not been seen for several decades, and 34 of these were listed as extinct by 2004. Here we report the rediscovery of the Hula painted frog, the first amphibian to have been declared extinct. We provide evidence that not only has this species survived undetected in its type locality for almost 60 years but also that it is a surviving member of an otherwise extinct genus of alytid frogs, Latonia, known only as fossils from Oligocene to Pleistocene in Europe. The survival of this living fossil is a striking example of resilience to severe habitat degradation during the past century by an amphibian.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Rebecca Biton","Eli Geffen","Miguel Vences","Orly Cohen","Salvador Bailon","Rivka Rabinovich","Yoram Malka","Talya Oron","Renaud Boistel","Vlad Brumfeld","Sarig Gafny"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms2959","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-06-04T15:40:04+00:00","issns":["2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130604/ncomms2959/full/ncomms2959.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms2959","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23736869"],"pmid":"23736869","pubdate":"2013-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"","title":"The rediscovered Hula painted frog is a living fossil.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/rediscovered-hula-painted-frog-living-fossil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":249.09,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":249.09},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5448619,"mean":6.3437074788522,"rank":13166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5435577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5448619,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96466,"mean":7.4379635308143,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":96189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96466,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9066,"mean":35.995968670711,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9066,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":23.627107491857,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":32,"researcher":11,"science_communicator":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":32,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":7,"Scientists":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Lecturer":2,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Researcher":13,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Master":6,"Professor":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Ph.
