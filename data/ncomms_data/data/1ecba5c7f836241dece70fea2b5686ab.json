electronic and optical properties not found in the constituent layers. Here, we present the direct synthesis of two unique, atomically thin, multi-junction heterostructures by combining graphene with the monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2). The realization of MoS2-WSe2-graphene and WSe2-MoS2-graphene heterostructures leads to resonant tunnelling in an atomically thin stack with spectrally narrow, room temperature negative differential resistance characteristics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Yu-Chuan Lin","Yu-Chuan Lin","Ram Krishna Ghosh","Rafik Addou","Ning Lu","Sarah M.
