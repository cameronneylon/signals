Building on seven decades of research, two different models have been proposed to explain its functional redox activity. One postulates that the intermolecular ET occurs only in the dominant, high-affinity protein-protein orientation, while the other posits formation of an additional, low-affinity complex, which is much more active than the dominant one. Unlike the high-affinity interaction-extensively studied by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy-until now the binding of cytochrome c to the low-affinity site has not been observed directly, but inferred mainly from kinetics experiments. Here we report the structure of this elusive, weak protein complex and show that it consists of a dominant, inactive bound species and an ensemble of minor, ET-competent protein-protein orientations, which summarily account for the experimentally determined value of the ET rate constant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Karen Van de Water","Karen Van de Water","Yann G.
