important role in the development of diabetes. Although the diabetogenic encephalomyocarditis strain D virus induces diabetes in restricted lines of inbred mice, the susceptibility genes to virus-induced diabetes have not been identified. We report here that novel Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) gene mutations are present in virus-induced diabetes-sensitive SJL and SWR mice. Mice carrying the mutant Tyk2 gene on the virus-resistant C57BL/6 background are highly sensitive to virus-induced diabetes. Tyk2 gene expression is strongly reduced in Tyk2-mutant mice, associated with low Tyk2 promoter activity, and leads to decreased expression of interferon-inducible genes, resulting in significantly compromised antiviral response. Tyk2-mutant pancreatic β-cells are unresponsive even to high dose of Type I interferon. Reversal of virus-induced diabetes could be achieved by β-cell-specific Tyk2 gene expression. Thus, reduced Tyk2 gene expression in pancreatic β-cells due to natural mutation is responsible for susceptibility to virus-induced diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Kenichi Izumi","Kenichi Izumi","Keiichiro Mine","Yoshitaka Inoue","Miho Teshima","Shuichiro Ogawa","Yuji Kai","Toshinobu Kurafuji","Kanako Hirakawa","Daiki Miyakawa","Haruka Ikeda","Akari Inada","Manami Hara","Hisakata Yamada","Koichi Akashi","Yoshiyuki Niho","Keisuke Ina","Takashi Kobayashi","Yasunobu Yoshikai","Keizo Anzai","Teruo Yamashita","Hiroko Minagawa","Shuji Fujimoto","Hironori Kurisaki","Kazuya Shimoda","Hitoshi Katsuta","Seiho Nagafuchi"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7748","first_seen_on":"2015-04-07T21:50:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150407/ncomms7748/full/ncomms7748.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150407/ncomms7748/full/ncomms7748.html?utm_content=buffer086d8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"25849081","pubdate":"2015-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Reduced Tyk2 gene expression in [beta]-cells due to natural mutation determines susceptibility to virus-induced diabetes","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/reduced-tyk2-gene-expression-%CE%B2cells-due-natural-mutation-determines-susceptibility-virusinduced-diab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5386376,"mean":6.2931844518822,"rank":1084082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4295996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5386376,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155985,"mean":10.217340252847,"rank":42880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":112802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155985,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8950,"mean":35.617420270421,"rank":5222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":3713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8950,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":34.975235920852,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Librarian":1,"Other":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
