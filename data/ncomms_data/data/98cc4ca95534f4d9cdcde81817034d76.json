Here we report a printable elastic conductor with a high initial conductivity of 738 S cm(-1) and a record high conductivity of 182 S cm(-1) when stretched to 215% strain. The elastic conductor ink is comprised of Ag flakes, a fluorine rubber and a fluorine surfactant. The fluorine surfactant constitutes a key component which directs the formation of surface-localized conductive networks in the printed elastic conductor, leading to a high conductivity and stretchability. We demonstrate the feasibility of our inks by fabricating a stretchable organic transistor active matrix on a rubbery stretchability-gradient substrate with unimpaired functionality when stretched to 110%, and a wearable electromyogram sensor printed onto a textile garment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Naoji Matsuhisa","Naoji Matsuhisa","Martin Kaltenbrunner","Tomoyuki Yokota","Hiroaki Jinno","Kazunori Kuribara","Tsuyoshi Sekitani","Takao Someya"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8461","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T11:17:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150625/ncomms8461/full/ncomms8461.html","http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms8461","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8461.epdf?shared_access_token=kl_nUOR6UyxmnFWLGWykMdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PzvZA6yYpZNiPv4QUbF_kDViSAAcKrq0vcOUAW-X1J0lbQdB2mdXqSORWqPeO__B5m6mIugNcldyxRQ9_6Ig_3Vfp1x1oqbPaB11xLLiTI877R9dGC13wXBsXo9mew0qc%3D","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8461.epdf?shared_access_token=RwDbI3UDSosm2LINzbH59tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PzvZA6yYpZNiPv4QUbF_kDViSAAcKrq0vcOUAW-X1J0lEg16NY2igifyawvVbmY82Y_0c7M0cEge-7OLf1PeQAVm_2mPQd0i7usPLy4fGL9QJeUlPs8TpexBy14iqqjks%3D","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8461","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8461","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms8461","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150625/ncomms8461/fig_tab/ncomms8461_F1.html"],"pmid":"26109453","pubdate":"2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Printable elastic conductors with a high conductivity for electronic textile applications","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/printable-elastic-conductors-high-conductivity-electronic-textile-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":124.91,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":124.91},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5452879,"mean":6.3483624515363,"rank":35074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5417806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5452879,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189495,"mean":8.4876643165484,"rank":1871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":187624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189495,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9069,"mean":36.112788928099,"rank":581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":8488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9069,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":32.098761904762,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":19,"Researcher":20,"Other":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Master":32,"Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":8,"Student  > Ph.
