However, its role in late-stage B-cell differentiation and function remains unexplored. Here we ablate mir-17-92 in mature B cells and demonstrate that mir-17-92 is dispensable for conventional B-cell development in the periphery. Interestingly, mir-17-92-deficiency in B cells leads to enhanced homing of plasma cells to the bone marrow during T-cell-dependent immune response and selectively impairs IgG2c production. Mechanistically, mir-17-92 directly represses the expression of Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 and transcription factor IKAROS, which are, respectively, important for plasma cell homing and IgG2c production. We further show that deletion of mir-17-92 could reduce IgG2c anti-DNA autoantibody production and hence mitigate immune complex glomerulonephritis in Shp1-deficient mice prone to autoimmunity. Our results identify important roles for mir-17-92 in the regulation of peripheral B-cell function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Shengli Xu","Xijun Ou","Jianxin Huo","Kristen Lim","Yuhan Huang","Sheena Chee","Kong-Peng Lam","Xu, Shengli","Ou, Xijun","Huo, Jianxin","Lim, Kristen","Huang, Yuhan","Chee, Sheena","Lam, Kong-Peng"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7764","first_seen_on":"2015-04-29T17:31:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150417/ncomms7764/full/ncomms7764.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881561?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25881561","pubdate":"2015-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Mir-17-92 regulates bone marrow homing of plasma cells and production of immunoglobulin G2c","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/mir1792-regulates-bone-marrow-homing-plasma-cells-production-immunoglobulin-g2c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325307,"mean":6.2415772840095,"rank":2643043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2522113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325307,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162050,"mean":9.7269784201077,"rank":86101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":69121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162050,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8826,"mean":35.276221869688,"rank":6863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":1735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8826,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":639,"mean":30.482250783699,"rank":511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":639,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
