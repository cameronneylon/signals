Chemotaxis and Contact Inhibition of Locomotion Determine Exploratory Cell Migration","TOP STORY A Digital Field Guide to Cancer Cells","Interplay between chemotaxis and contact inhibition of locomotion determines exploratory cell migrat"],"citation":{"abstract":"Directed cell migration in native environments is influenced by multiple migratory cues. These cues may include simultaneously occurring attractive soluble growth factor gradients and repulsive effects arising from cell-cell contact, termed contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). How single cells reconcile potentially conflicting cues remains poorly understood. Here we show that a dynamic crosstalk between epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated chemotaxis and CIL guides metastatic breast cancer cell motility, whereby cells become progressively insensitive to CIL in a chemotactic input-dependent manner. This balance is determined via integration of protrusion-enhancing signalling from EGF gradients and protrusion-suppressing signalling induced by CIL, mediated in part through EphB. Our results further suggest that EphB and EGF signalling inputs control protrusion formation by converging onto regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We propose that this intricate interplay may enhance the spread of loose cell ensembles in pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, and possibly other physiological settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Benjamin Lin","Taofei Yin","Yi I.
