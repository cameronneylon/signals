cellulolyticum uses a genome-wide RNA-encoded strategy to control the stoichiometry of protein complexes"],"citation":{"abstract":"The mechanism, physiological relevance and evolutionary implication of selective RNA processing and stabilization (SRPS) remain elusive. Here we report the genome-wide maps of transcriptional start sites (TSs) and post-transcriptional processed sites (PSs) for Clostridium cellulolyticum. The PS-associated genes are preferably associated with subunits of heteromultimeric protein complexes, and the intergenic PSs (iPSs) are enriched in operons exhibiting highly skewed transcript-abundance landscape. Stem-loop structures associated with those iPSs located at 3' termini of highly transcribed genes exhibit folding free energy negatively correlated with transcript-abundance ratio of flanking genes. In the cellulosome-encoding cip-cel operon, iPSs and stem-loops precisely regulate structure and abundance of the subunit-encoding transcripts processed from a primary polycistronic RNA, quantitatively specifying cellulosome stoichiometry. Moreover, cellulosome evolution is shaped by the number, position and biophysical nature of TSs, iPSs and stem-loops. Our findings unveil a genome-wide RNA-encoded strategy controlling in vivo stoichiometry of protein complexes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Chenggang Xu","Chenggang Xu","Ranran Huang","Lin Teng","Xiaoyan Jing","Jianqiang Hu","Guzhen Cui","Yilin Wang","Qiu Cui","Jian Xu"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7900","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T16:55:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150424/ncomms7900/full/ncomms7900.html"],"pmid":"25908225","pubdate":"2015-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Cellulosome stoichiometry in Clostridium cellulolyticum is regulated by selective RNA processing and stabilization","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/cellulosome-stoichiometry-clostridium-cellulolyticum-regulated-selective-rna-processing-stabilizatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":518288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4508330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156575,"mean":9.7051350543513,"rank":25794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":130363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156575,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208,"mean":33.721238698672,"rank":3918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":629,"mean":32.252385350318,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":629,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
