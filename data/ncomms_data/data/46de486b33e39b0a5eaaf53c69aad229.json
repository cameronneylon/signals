a demixing salad dressing, oil droplets don't just bump at random: they are driven by hydrodynamics","Nice article on the phase transition physics in a salad dressing. / “ncomms8407.html”"],"citation":{"abstract":"In our daily lives, after shaking a salad dressing, we see the coarsening of oil droplets suspended in vinegar. Such a demixing process is observed everywhere in nature and also of technological importance. For a case of high droplet density, domain coarsening proceeds with inter-droplet collisions and the resulting coalescence. This phenomenon has been explained primarily by the so-called Brownian-coagulation mechanism: stochastic thermal forces exerted by molecules induce random motion of individual droplets, causing accidental collisions and subsequent interface-tension-driven coalescence. Contrary to this, here we demonstrate that the droplet motion is not random, but hydrodynamically driven by the composition Marangoni force due to an interfacial tension gradient produced in each droplet as a consequence of composition correlation among droplets. This alters our physical understanding of droplet coarsening in immiscible liquid mixtures on a fundamental level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Ryotaro Shimizu","Ryotaro Shimizu","Hajime Tanaka"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8407","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T05:38:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms8407","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150616/ncomms8407/full/ncomms8407.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8407","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms8407"],"pmid":"26077672","pubdate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"A novel coarsening mechanism of droplets in immiscible fluid mixtures","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/novel-coarsening-mechanism-droplets-immiscible-fluid-mixtures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":33.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":33.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376373,"mean":6.2844684411718,"rank":157685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":5218630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376373,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186301,"mean":8.5391564358563,"rank":8473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":177821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186301,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8936,"mean":35.575778175713,"rank":2379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":6556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8936,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":707,"mean":32.627943342776,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":707,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
