All very best to you from Celentyx :-)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Random recombination of antibody heavy- and light-chain genes results in a diverse B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire including self-reactive BCRs. However, tolerance mechanisms that prevent the development of self-reactive B cells remain incompletely understood. The absence of the surrogate light chain, which assembles with antibody heavy chain forming a pre-BCR, leads to production of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). Here we show that the naive follicular B-cell pool is enriched for cells expressing prototypic ANA heavy chains in these mice in a non-autoimmune background with a broad antibody repertoire. This results in the spontaneous formation of T-cell-dependent germinal centres that are enriched with B cells expressing prototypic ANA heavy chains. However, peripheral tolerance appears maintained by selection thresholds on cells entering the memory B-cell and plasma cell pools, as exemplified by the exclusion of cells expressing the intrinsically self-reactive VH81X from both pools.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Grimsholm, Ola","Ren, Weicheng","Bernardi, Angelina I","Chen, Haixia","Park, Giljun","Camponeschi, Alessandro","Chen, Dongfeng","Bergmann, Berglind","Höök, Nina","Andersson, Sofia","Strömberg, Anneli","Gjertsson, Inger","Cardell, Susanna","Yrlid, Ulf","De Riva, Alessandra","Mårtensson, Inga-Lill"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8077","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T12:17:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959489","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959489?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25959489","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Absence of surrogate light chain results in spontaneous autoreactive germinal centres expanding VH81X-expressing B cells.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/absence-surrogate-light-chain-results-spontaneous-autoreactive-germinal-centres-expanding-vh81xexpre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450554,"mean":6.3470462938347,"rank":2896474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1851618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450554,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176591,"mean":9.1005191573702,"rank":100546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":58954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176591,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9068,"mean":36.091697364067,"rank":7310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9068,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":721,"mean":30.986780555556,"rank":590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":721,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https://twitter.com/profcelentyx/status/598164115278925824","posted_on":"2015-05-12T16:33:33+00:00","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4016177],"author":{"name":"John Gordon","url":"http://www.celentyx.com","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/595982941362216961/8117QmlG_normal.jpg","description":"Emeritus (i.e. 'Ancient') Professor of Immunology; CSO Celentyx Ltd (My Day Job); Foodie (Yum), Indie (Old Hippy sans Hair), & B-Cell (bit sad, I know) Fan","id_on_source":"profcelentyx","tweeter_id":"3239042735","geo":{"lt":52.5,"ln":-3.5,"country":"GB"},"followers":138},"tweet_id":"598164115278925824"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/TumorImm_papers/status/598108000188928002","posted_on":"2015-05-12T12:50:34+00:00","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4016177],"author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/741322452093931520/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
