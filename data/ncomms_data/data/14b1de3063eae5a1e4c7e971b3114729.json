signalling. The actin cytoskeleton has been suggested as a target for innate immune signalling and a key transducer of cellular responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying actin remodelling and the precise functions of these rearrangements during innate immunity remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate rapid actin remodelling in response to several distinct MAMP signalling pathways in plant epidermal cells. The regulation of actin dynamics is a convergence point for basal defence machinery, such as cell wall fortification and transcriptional reprogramming. Our quantitative analyses of actin dynamics and genetic studies reveal that MAMP-stimulated actin remodelling is due to the inhibition of capping protein (CP) by the signalling lipid, phosphatidic acid. In addition, CP promotes resistance against bacterial and fungal phytopathogens. These findings demonstrate that CP is a central target for the plant innate immune response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Li, Jiejie","Henty-Ridilla, Jessica L","Staiger, Benjamin H","Day, Brad","Staiger, Christopher J"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8206","first_seen_on":"2015-05-29T16:26:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018794?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8206.epdf?shared_access_token=BqR92_hsMNlQI6HADXaEktRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Ps6M70Sg9XnwvH2Nnur-V2KNCu8jD0NC6Q0IvwVam2_xthPyJdjdScw7zRZx0W3jiQANVql9dHqNGijReBWnf14r39elPVnI2LoOoHAY7H9Qh8lsTJFS5_6S0z2YgGGw-NjDlOH8yDvGj1p3XYeyC3Hx-cjpN8UA9Q2k--0_3gDQ%3D%3D","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150528/ncomms8206/full/ncomms8206.html"],"pmid":"26018794","pubdate":"2015-05-29T22:01:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Capping protein integrates multiple MAMP signalling pathways to modulate actin dynamics during plant innate immunity","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/capping-protein-integrates-multiple-mamp-signalling-pathways-modulate-actin-dynamics-during-plant-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325510,"mean":6.2413581056763,"rank":2299011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2954465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325510,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175628,"mean":8.9055835492267,"rank":76432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":96888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175628,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8826,"mean":35.269684532578,"rank":6394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":2378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8826,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":717,"mean":31.535589385475,"rank":524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":717,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Researcher":14,"Other":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
