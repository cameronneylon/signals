Direct, real-time manipulation and measurement of single-cell responses to chemokines is highly desired for investigating the cell biology of lymphocyte migration in vivo. Here we report the development of the first two-photon-activatable chemokine CCL5 through efficient one-pot total chemical synthesis in milligram scale. By spatiotemporally controlled photoactivation, we show at the single-cell level that T cells perceive the directional cue without relying on PI3K activities, which are nonetheless required for persistent migration over an extended period of time. By intravital imaging, we demonstrate artificial T-cell positioning in cutaneous tissues and lymph nodes. This work establishes a general strategy to develop high-quality photo-activatable protein agents through tailor-designed caging of multiple residues and highlights the potential of photo-activatable chemokines for understanding and potential therapeutic manipulation of cell positioning and position-controlled cell behaviours in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Chen, Xin","Tang, Shan","Zheng, Ji-Shen","Zhao, Ruozhu","Wang, Zhi-Peng","Shao, Wen","Chang, Hao-Nan","Cheng, Jing-Yuan","Zhao, Hui","Liu, Lei","Qi, Hai"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8220","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T12:12:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26008852?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150526/ncomms8220/full/ncomms8220.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8220"],"pmid":"26008852","pubdate":"2015-05-27T22:04:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Chemical synthesis of a two-photon-activatable chemokine and photon-guided lymphocyte migration in vivo.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/chemical-synthesis-twophotonactivatable-chemokine-photonguided-lymphocyte-migration-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.75,"score_history":{"1y":10.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5342821,"mean":6.2521877180985,"rank":449464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4891215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5342821,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176124,"mean":8.918313371905,"rank":22489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":153507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176124,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8856,"mean":35.350138678713,"rank":3919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8856,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":724,"mean":31.172307053942,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":724,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
