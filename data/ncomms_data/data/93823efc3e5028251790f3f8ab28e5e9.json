However, mechanisms acutely controlling ADAM17 cell-surface availability to modulate the extent of ErbB ligand release are poorly understood. Here, through a functional genome-wide siRNA screen, we identify the sorting protein PACS-2 as a regulator of ADAM17 trafficking and ErbB signalling. PACS-2 loss reduces ADAM17 cell-surface levels and ADAM17-dependent ErbB ligand shedding, without apparent effects on related proteases. PACS-2 co-localizes with ADAM17 on early endosomes and PACS-2 knockdown decreases the recycling and stability of internalized ADAM17. Hence, PACS-2 sustains ADAM17 cell-surface activity by diverting ADAM17 away from degradative pathways. Interestingly, Pacs2-deficient mice display significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated EGFR and intestinal proliferation. We suggest that this mechanism controlling ADAM17 cell-surface availability and EGFR signalling may play a role in intestinal homeostasis, with potential implications for cancer biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Sarah Louise Dombernowsky","Sarah Louise Dombernowsky","Jacob Samsøe-Petersen","Camilla Hansson Petersen","Rachael Instrell","Anne-Mette Bornhardt Hedegaard","Laurel Thomas","Katelyn Mae Atkins","Sylvain Auclair","Reidar Albrechtsen","Kasper Johansen Mygind","Camilla Fröhlich","Michael Howell","Peter Parker","Gary Thomas","Marie Kveiborg"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8518","first_seen_on":"2015-06-29T14:55:07+00:00","funders":["nci","niehs","nigms"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150625/ncomms8518/full/ncomms8518.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8518"],"pmid":"26108729","pubdate":"2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"The sorting protein PACS-2 promotes ErbB signalling by regulating recycling of the metalloproteinase ADAM17","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/sorting-protein-pacs2-promotes-erbb-signalling-regulating-recycling-metalloproteinase-adam17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":30.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":30.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5320782,"mean":6.2376402783738,"rank":169422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5151151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5320782,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187552,"mean":8.4389941189331,"rank":9194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":178349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187552,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8818,"mean":35.212389248044,"rank":2467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":6349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8818,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":32.620579020979,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Ph.
