Here, we modelled a newly discovered product-to-parent reversion pathway for trenbolone acetate (TBA) metabolites. We show increased exposure to the primary metabolite, 17α-trenbolone (17α-TBOH), and elevated concentrations of the still-bioactive primary photoproduct hydroxylated 17α-TBOH, produced via phototransformation and then converted back to 17α-trenbolone in perpetually dark hyporheic zones that exchange continuously with surface water photic zones. The increased persistence equates to a greater potential hazard from parent-product joint bioactivity at locations and times when reversion is a dominant trenbolone fate pathway. Our study highlights uncertainties and vulnerabilities with current paradigms in risk characterization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Adam S. Ward","Adam S. Ward","David M.
