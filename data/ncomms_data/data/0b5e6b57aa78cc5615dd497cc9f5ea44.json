ability to control light propagation in photonic integrated circuits is at the foundation of modern light-based communication. However, the inherent crosstalk in densely packed waveguides and the lack of robust control of the coupling are a major roadblock toward ultra-high density photonic integrated circuits. As a result, the diffraction limit is often considered as the lower bound for ultra-dense silicon photonics circuits. Here we experimentally demonstrate an active control of the coupling between two closely packed waveguides via the interaction with a decoupled waveguide. This control scheme is analogous to the adiabatic elimination, a well-known procedure in atomic physics. This approach offers an attractive solution for ultra-dense integrated nanophotonics for light-based communications and integrated quantum computing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Michael Mrejen","Michael Mrejen","Haim Suchowski","Taiki Hatakeyama","Chihhui Wu","Liang Feng","Kevin Oâ€™Brien","Yuan Wang","Xiang Zhang"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8565","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T23:37:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8565","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150626/ncomms8565/full/ncomms8565.html","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms8565"],"pmid":"26113179","pubdate":"2015-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Adiabatic elimination-based coupling control in densely packed subwavelength waveguides","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/adiabatic-eliminationbased-coupling-control-densely-packed-subwavelength-waveguides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":30.482,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":30.482},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5291770,"mean":6.2217234724363,"rank":169560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5122249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5291770,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186409,"mean":8.4547819085019,"rank":9263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":177146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186409,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8758,"mean":35.029247687564,"rank":2472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":6286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8758,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":719,"mean":32.477824512535,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":719,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Researcher":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
