Tat-directed proteins are distinguished by a conserved twin-arginine (RR-) motif in their signal sequences. Many Tat systems are based on the membrane proteins TatA, TatB and TatC, of which TatB and TatC are known to cooperate in binding RR-signal peptides and to form higher-order oligomeric structures. We have now elucidated the fine architecture of TatBC oligomers assembled to form closed intramembrane substrate-binding cavities. The identification of distinct homonymous and heteronymous contacts between TatB and TatC suggest that TatB monomers coalesce into dome-like TatB structures that are surrounded by outer rings of TatC monomers. We also show that these TatBC complexes are approached by TatA protomers through their N-termini, which thereby establish contacts with TatB and membrane-inserted RR-precursors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Blümmel, Anne-Sophie","Haag, Laura A","Eimer, Ekaterina","Müller, Matthias","Fröbel, Julia"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8234","first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T15:11:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068441?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"26068441","pubdate":"2015-06-13T22:02:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Initial assembly steps of a translocase for folded proteins.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/initial-assembly-steps-translocase-folded-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5223626,"mean":6.1581687165544,"rank":2768383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1774832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5223626,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178144,"mean":8.6377265343012,"rank":99538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178144,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8583,"mean":34.686093684456,"rank":6872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8583,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":701,"mean":32.238488571429,"rank":576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":701,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Ph.
