alteration is a hallmark of cancer. Dysregulation of methionine metabolism is implicated in human liver cancer. Methionine adenosyltransferase IIα (MAT IIα) is a key enzyme in the methionine cycle, catalysing the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a key methyl donor in cellular processes, and is associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer. Here we show that P300 acetylates MAT IIα at lysine residue 81 and destabilizes MAT IIα by promoting its ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Conversely, histone deacetylase-3 deacetylates and stabilizes MAT IIα by preventing its proteasomal degradation. Folate deprivation upregulates K81 acetylation and destabilizes MAT IIα to moderate cell proliferation, whereas a single mutation at K81 reverses the proliferative disadvantage of cancer cells upon folate deprivation. Moreover, MAT IIα K81 acetylation is decreased in human hepatocellular cancer. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanism of MAT IIα regulation by acetylation and ubiquitylation, and a direct functional link of this regulation to cancer development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Yang, Hong-Bin","Xu, Ying-Ying","Zhao, Xiang-Ning","Zou, Shao-Wu","Zhang, Ye","Zhang, Min","Li, Jin-Tao","Ren, Feng","Wang, Li-Ying","Lei, Qun-Ying"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7973","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T13:25:01+00:00","issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925782?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25925782","pubdate":"2015-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"6973","subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Acetylation of MAT IIα represses tumour cell growth and is decreased in human hepatocellular cancer","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/acetylation-mat-iialpha-represses-tumour-cell-growth-decreased-human-hepatocellular-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234236,"mean":6.1677733934399,"rank":2774178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1778602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234236,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229810,"mean":11.067296789943,"rank":124158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":81344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229810,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8612,"mean":34.776110788526,"rank":6903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8612,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":53.076801980198,"rank":665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http://twitter.com/HPB_surgery/statuses/710057346970427393","posted_on":"2016-03-16T10:57:18+00:00","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6197803],"author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/643215676610490368/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":183},"tweet_id":"710057346970427393"}]},"score":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt"}}
