Overview"],"citation":{"abstract":"Tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies influence the atmospheric circulation, impacting climate far beyond the tropics. The predictability of the corresponding atmospheric signals is typically limited to less than 1 year lead time. Here we present observational and modelling evidence for multi-year predictability of coherent trans-basin climate variations that are characterized by a zonal seesaw in tropical sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure between the Pacific and the other two ocean basins. State-of-the-art climate model forecasts initialized from a realistic ocean state show that the low-frequency trans-basin climate variability, which explains part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation flavours, can be predicted up to 3 years ahead, thus exceeding the predictive skill of current tropical climate forecasts for natural variability. This low-frequency variability emerges from the synchronization of ocean anomalies in all basins via global reorganizations of the atmospheric Walker Circulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Yoshimitsu Chikamoto","Yoshimitsu Chikamoto","Axel Timmermann","Jing-Jia Luo","Takashi Mochizuki","Masahide Kimoto","Masahiro Watanabe","Masayoshi Ishii","Shang-Ping Xie","Fei-Fei Jin"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7869","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T08:33:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150421/ncomms7869/full/ncomms7869.html","http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms7869","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7869"],"pmid":"25897996","pubdate":"2015-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Skilful multi-year predictions of tropical trans-basin climate variability","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/skilful-multiyear-predictions-tropical-transbasin-climate-variability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5042185,"mean":5.9754557227593,"rank":134721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":4907124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5042185,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154831,"mean":9.8034672867017,"rank":7937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":146884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154831,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8239,"mean":33.720945132314,"rank":2084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8239,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":637,"mean":31.972525157233,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":637,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":11,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
