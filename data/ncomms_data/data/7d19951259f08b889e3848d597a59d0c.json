In this pathway, the signal recognition particle (SRP) first recognizes the N-terminal signal sequence of nascent proteins and subsequently interacts with the SRP receptor. For this, signal sequence binding in the SRP54 M domain must be effectively communicated to the SRP54 NG domain that interacts with the receptor. Here we present the 2.9 Å crystal structure of unbound- and signal sequence bound SRP forms, both present in the asymmetric unit. The structures provide evidence for a coupled binding and folding mechanism in which signal sequence binding induces the concerted folding of the GM linker helix, the finger loop, and the C-terminal alpha helix αM6. This mechanism allows for a high degree of structural adaptability of the binding site and suggests how signal sequence binding in the M domain is coupled to repositioning of the NG domain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Tobias Hainzl","A.
