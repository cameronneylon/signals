Here, we characterize those changes using 11 antibodies that were epitope mapped using peptide arrays and mutagenesis. After Bak activation by Bid, epitopes throughout the α1 helix are exposed indicating complete dissociation of α1 from α2 in the core and from α6-α8 in the latch. Moreover, disulfide tethering of α1 to α2 or α6 blocks cytochrome c release, suggesting that α1 dissociation is required for further conformational changes during apoptosis. Assaying epitope exposure when α1 is tethered shows that Bid triggers α2 movement, followed by α1 dissociation. However, α2 reaches its final position only after α1 dissociates from the latch. Thus, α1 dissociation is a key step in unfolding Bak into three major components, the N terminus, the core (α2-α5) and the latch (α6-α8).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Alsop, Amber E","Fennell, Stephanie C","Bartolo, Ray C","Tan, Iris K L","Dewson, Grant","Kluck, Ruth M"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7841","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T17:15:31+00:00","issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","pmid":"25880232","pubdate":"2015-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"6841","subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Dissociation of Bak α1 helix from the core and latch domains is required for apoptosis","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/dissociation-bak-%CE%B11-helix-core-latch-domains-required-apoptosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
