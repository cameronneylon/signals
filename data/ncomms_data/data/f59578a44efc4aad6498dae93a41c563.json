lab"],"citation":{"abstract":"Defining the immune mechanisms underlying protective immunity to helminth infection remains an important challenge. Here we report that lung CD4(+) T cells and Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) work in concert to block Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) development in the parenchyma within 48 h in mice. Immune-damaged larvae have a striking morphological defect that is dependent on the expansion of IL-13-producing ILC2 and CD4(+) T cells, and the activation of M2 macrophages. This T-cell requirement can be bypassed by administration of IL-2 or IL-33, resulting in expansion of IL-13-producing ILC2s and larval killing. Depletion of ILC2s inhibits larval killing in IL-2-treated mice. Our results broaden understanding of ILC2's role in immunity to helminths by demonstrating that they not only act as alarmin sensors, but can also be sustained by CD4(+) T cells, ensuring both the prompt activation and the maintenance of IL-13-dependent M2 macrophage immunity in the lung.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Tiffany Bouchery","Ryan Kyle","Mali Camberis","Amy Shepherd","Kara Filbey","Alexander Smith","Marina Harvie","Gavin Painter","Karen Johnston","Peter Ferguson","Rohit Jain","Ben Roediger","Brett Delahunt","Wolfgang Weninger","Elizabeth Forbes-Blom","Graham Le Gros","Bouchery, Tiffany","Kyle, Ryan","Camberis, Mali","Shepherd, Amy","Filbey, Kara","Smith, Alexander","Harvie, Marina","Painter, Gavin","Johnston, Karen","Ferguson, Peter","Jain, Rohit","Roediger, Ben","Delahunt, Brett","Weninger, Wolfgang","Forbes-Blom, Elizabeth","Le Gros, Graham"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7970","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T14:59:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150427/ncomms7970/full/ncomms7970.html","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7970","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms7970.epdf?shared_access_token=iakmrzTYfpZ1O497fD0-CdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OHCrI32fMEcpBuiazLlt34WJqQMRdrmiIypOH0hyszLwaG06sf8rBlpUTMu1667-8fq0nXnulGp4jhhxoyTVKf47VVjFru4Cy3seuVR2stHvOVTdup--Zc3dZ4v8d5CEJ5djZWYht0TOLK2ALWdhAuMzaQEOWPJK2yO40axOgY3w%3D%3D","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912172?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25912172","pubdate":"2015-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"ILC2s and T cells cooperate to ensure maintenance of M2 macrophages for lung immunity against hookworms.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/ilc2s-t-cells-cooperate-ensure-maintenance-m2-macrophages-lung-immunity-against-hookworms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234383,"mean":6.167954959728,"rank":536989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4696269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234383,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160103,"mean":9.7111824836668,"rank":25847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":134195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160103,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8612,"mean":34.780134246893,"rank":4095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8612,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":30.876224719101,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":7,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
