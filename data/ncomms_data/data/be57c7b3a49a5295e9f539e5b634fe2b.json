node (LN)-like vasculature in tumours, characterized by expression of peripheral node addressin and chemokine CCL21, is correlated with T-cell infiltration and positive prognosis in breast cancer and melanoma patients. However, mechanisms controlling the development of LN-like vasculature and how it might contribute to a beneficial outcome for cancer patients are unknown. Here we demonstrate that LN-like vasculature is present in murine models of melanoma and lung carcinoma. It enables infiltration by naive T cells that significantly delay tumour outgrowth after intratumoral activation. Development of this vasculature is controlled by a mechanism involving effector CD8 T cells and NK cells that secrete LTα3 and IFNγ. LN-like vasculature is also associated with organized aggregates of B lymphocytes and gp38(+) fibroblasts, which resemble tertiary lymphoid organs that develop in models of chronic inflammation. These results establish LN-like vasculature as both a consequence of and key contributor to anti-tumour immunity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Peske, J David","Thompson, Elizabeth D","Gemta, Lelisa","Baylis, Richard A","Fu, Yang-Xin","Engelhard, Victor H"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8114","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:33:52+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci","nigms","niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968334?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968334?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25968334","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Effector lymphocyte-induced lymph node-like vasculature enables naive T-cell entry into tumours and enhanced anti-tumour immunity.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/effector-lymphocyteinduced-lymph-nodelike-vasculature-enables-naive-tcell-entry-tumours-enhanced-ant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450554,"mean":6.3470462938347,"rank":3836580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":914732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450554,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176598,"mean":9.1001980667849,"rank":126192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":31135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176598,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9068,"mean":36.091697364067,"rank":8077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9068,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":721,"mean":30.986780555556,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":721,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Ph.
