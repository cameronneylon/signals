(ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease thought to employ cell non-autonomous mechanisms where neuronal injury engages immune responses to influence disease progression. Here we show that the expression of mutant proteins causative for ALS in Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons induces an innate immune response via TIR-1/Sarm1. Loss of function mutations in tir-1, associated downstream kinases, and the transcription factor atf-7 all suppress motor neuron degeneration. The neurosecretory proteins UNC-13 and UNC-31 are required for induction of the immune response as well as the degeneration of motor neurons. The human orthologue of UNC-13, UNC13A, has been identified as a genetic modifier of survival in ALS, and we provide functional evidence of UNC-13/UNC13A in regulating motor neuron degeneration. We propose that the innate immune system reacts to the presence of mutant proteins as a contagion, recruiting a pathogen resistance response that is ultimately harmful and drives progressive neurodegeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Julie Vérièpe","Lucresse Fossouo","J Alex Parker","Vérièpe, Julie","Fossouo, Lucresse","Parker, J Alex"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8319","first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T14:29:24+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150610/ncomms8319/abs/ncomms8319.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150610/ncomms8319/full/ncomms8319.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059317?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms8319","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059317","http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8319.epdf?shared_access_token=JKf1o5pA-PcFZ3Bt-jFEzdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Opw8zj0BoRAHjLOgPivj7YRGi_OnNODeRZTzb43jSJNCxn3N1Fo8ZgOmZQBXdwjvc2DgELwoykE5IM3BgJqicBx_VPe5GJYo8kmElOLf1tQGayQlRHXRN6VM4gyER3jXc%3D","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8319","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059317?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26059317","pubdate":"2015-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Neurodegeneration in C. elegans models of ALS requires TIR-1/Sarm1 immune pathway activation in neurons","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/neurodegeneration-c-elegans-models-als-requires-tir1sarm1-immune-pathway-activation-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":54.296,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":54.296},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5411815,"mean":6.3089083834009,"rank":98311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":5313708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5411815,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180273,"mean":8.727617145203,"rank":5148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":175125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180273,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9000,"mean":35.756856317369,"rank":1694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":7306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9000,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":698,"mean":32.626978479197,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":698,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":18,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":18,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Researcher":8,"Other":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Ph.
