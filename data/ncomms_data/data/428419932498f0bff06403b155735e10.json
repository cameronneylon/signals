However, there are remaining challenges in terms of polychromatic configuration, electroluminescence efficiency and/or multidirectional deformability. Here we present ultra-thin, wearable colloidal quantum dot light-emitting diode arrays utilizing the intaglio transfer printing technique, which allows the alignment of red-green-blue pixels with high resolutions up to 2,460 pixels per inch. This technique is readily scalable and adaptable for low-voltage-driven pixelated white quantum dot light-emitting diodes and electronic tattoos, showing the best electroluminescence performance (14,000 cd m(-2) at 7 V) among the wearable light-emitting diodes reported up to date. The device performance is stable on flat, curved and convoluted surfaces under mechanical deformations such as bending, crumpling and wrinkling. These deformable device arrays highlight new possibilities for integrating high-definition full-colour displays in wearable electronics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Moon Kee Choi","Jiwoong Yang","Kwanghun Kang","Dong Chan Kim","Changsoon Choi","Chaneui Park","Seok Joo Kim","Sue In Chae","Tae-Ho Kim","Ji Hoon Kim","Taeghwan Hyeon","Dae-Hyeong Kim"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8149","first_seen_on":"2015-05-14T16:25:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html","http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms8149","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms8149","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8149","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/fig_tab/ncomms8149_ft.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer87fb3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer39bf7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer45375&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffere64ae&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=bufferee467&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer25d76&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer8d945&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=bufferd330f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer98d64&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=bufferf24c9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer5dec1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150514/ncomms8149/full/ncomms8149.html?utm_content=buffer46d34&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"25971194","pubdate":"2015-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Wearable red-green-blue quantum dot light-emitting diode array using high-resolution intaglio transfer printing","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/wearable-redgreenblue-quantum-dot-lightemitting-diode-array-using-highresolution-intaglio-transfer-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":74.15,"score_history":{"1y":14,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":74.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422382,"mean":6.3136344723843,"rank":68379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":5353894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422382,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168453,"mean":9.3487815520149,"rank":3637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":164815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168453,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9018,"mean":35.90156393479,"rank":1234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9018,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":29.421019886364,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":7,"Researcher":21,"Other":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Master":19,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
