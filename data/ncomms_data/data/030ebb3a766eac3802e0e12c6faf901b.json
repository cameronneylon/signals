Li, L. et al"],"citation":{"abstract":"In situ techniques with high temporal, spatial and chemical resolution are key to understand ubiquitous solid-state phase transformations, which are crucial to many technological applications. Hard X-ray spectro-imaging can visualize electrochemically driven phase transformations but demands considerably large samples with strong absorption signal so far. Here we show a conceptually new data analysis method to enable operando visualization of mechanistically relevant weakly absorbing samples at the nanoscale and study electrochemical reaction dynamics of iron fluoride, a promising high-capacity conversion cathode material. In two specially designed samples with distinctive microstructure and porosity, we observe homogeneous phase transformations during both discharge and charge, faster and more complete Li-storage occurring in porous polycrystalline iron fluoride, and further, incomplete charge reaction following a pathway different from conventional belief. These mechanistic insights provide guidelines for designing better conversion cathode materials to realize the promise of high-capacity lithium-ion batteries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Linsen Li","Linsen Li","Yu-chen Karen Chen-Wiegart","Jiajun Wang","Peng Gao","Qi Ding","Young-Sang Yu","Feng Wang","Jordi Cabana","Jun Wang","Song Jin"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7883","first_seen_on":"2015-04-20T21:11:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7883","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150420/ncomms7883/full/ncomms7883.html","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncomms7883"],"pmid":"25892338","pubdate":"2015-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Visualization of electrochemically driven solid-state phase transformations using operando hard X-ray spectro-imaging","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/visualization-electrochemically-driven-solidstate-phase-transformations-using-operando-hard-xray-spe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":88.264,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":88.264},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032982,"mean":5.9702113860563,"rank":46667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":4986296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032982,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154388,"mean":9.8190845472743,"rank":2988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":151400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154388,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8221,"mean":33.740450851581,"rank":819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8221,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":647,"mean":32.02153250774,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":647,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Other":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Ph.
