GRB 060614, that lasted 102 s, lacks a supernova-like emission down to very stringent limits and its physical origin is still debated. Here we report the discovery of near-infrared bump that is significantly above the regular decaying afterglow. This red bump is inconsistent with even the weakest known supernova. However, it can arise from a Li-Paczyński macronova-the radioactive decay of debris following a compact binary merger. If this interpretation is correct, GRB 060614 arose from a compact binary merger rather than from the death of a massive star and it was a site of a significant production of heavy r-process elements. The significant ejected mass favours a black hole-neutron star merger but a double neutron star merger cannot be ruled out.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Bin Yang","Bin Yang","Zhi-Ping Jin","Xiang Li","Stefano Covino","Xian-Zhong Zheng","Kenta Hotokezaka","Yi-Zhong Fan","Tsvi Piran","Da-Ming Wei"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms8323","first_seen_on":"2015-06-24T11:01:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150611/ncomms8323/full/ncomms8323.html"],"pmid":"26065563","pubdate":"2015-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"A possible macronova in the late afterglow of the long-short burst GRB 060614","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/possible-macronova-late-afterglow-longshort-burst-grb-060614"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5273580,"mean":6.2055386742117,"rank":2797421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1790777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5273580,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186182,"mean":8.4789052588611,"rank":103023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186182,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8707,"mean":34.942182173214,"rank":6983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8707,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":732,"mean":32.198010943912,"rank":606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":732,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Ph.
