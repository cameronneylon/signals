integration of discrete biological processes during complex physiological events. Utilizing the common human condition tendinopathy as a model system to explore the cross-regulation of immediate inflammation and matrix synthesis by miRNA we observed that elevated IL-33 expression is a characteristic of early tendinopathy. Using in vitro tenocyte cultures and in vivo models of tendon damage, we demonstrate that such IL-33 expression plays a pivotal role in the transition from type 1 to type 3 collagen (Col3) synthesis and thus early tendon remodelling. Both IL-33 effector function, via its decoy receptor sST2, and Col3 synthesis are regulated by miRNA29a. Downregulation of miRNA29a in human tenocytes is sufficient to induce an increase in Col3 expression. These data provide a molecular mechanism of miRNA-mediated integration of the early pathophysiologic events that facilitate tissue remodelling in human tendon after injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Millar, Neal L","Gilchrist, Derek S","Akbar, Moeed","Reilly, James H","Kerr, Shauna C","Campbell, Abigail L","Murrell, George A C","Liew, Foo Y","Kurowska-Stolarska, Mariola","McInnes, Iain B"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7774","first_seen_on":"2015-04-12T02:56:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome","aruk"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857925?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7774","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150410/ncomms7774/full/ncomms7774.html","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150410/ncomms7774/abs/ncomms7774.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=25857925","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857925","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403384"],"pmid":"25857925","pubdate":"2015-04-12T22:04:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"MicroRNA29a regulates IL-33-mediated tissue remodelling in tendon disease","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/microrna29a-regulates-il33mediated-tissue-remodelling-tendon-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":29.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":29.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5452879,"mean":6.3483624515363,"rank":181954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5270777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5452879,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158581,"mean":10.080545402951,"rank":9655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":148917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158581,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9069,"mean":36.119042346714,"rank":2609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":6456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9069,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":659,"mean":34.598282674772,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":659,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":5,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Scientists":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":6,"Other":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Ph.
