Neuroscientists present odor to locust, record from antennal lobe, and found -- you guessed it -- spikes!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Most sensory stimuli evoke spiking responses that are distributed across neurons and are temporally structured. Whether the temporal structure of ensemble activity is modulated to facilitate different neural computations is not known. Here, we investigated this issue in the insect olfactory system. We found that an odourant can generate synchronous or asynchronous spiking activity across a neural ensemble in the antennal lobe circuit depending on its relative novelty with respect to a preceding stimulus. Regardless of variations in temporal spiking patterns, the activated combinations of neurons robustly represented stimulus identity. Consistent with this interpretation, locusts reliably recognized both solitary and sequential introductions of trained odourants in a quantitative behavioural assay. However, predictable behavioural responses across locusts were observed only to novel stimuli that evoked synchronized spiking patterns across neural ensembles. Hence, our results indicate that the combinatorial ensemble response encodes for stimulus identity, whereas the temporal structure of the ensemble response selectively emphasizes novel stimuli.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Debajit Saha","Debajit Saha","Chao Li","Steven Peterson","William Padovano","Nalin Katta","Baranidharan Raman"],"doi":"10.1038/ncomms7953","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T22:32:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","links":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7953","http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150427/ncomms7953/full/ncomms7953.html"],"pmid":"25912016","pubdate":"2015-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology","science"],"title":"Behavioural correlates of combinatorial versus temporal features of odour codes","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/behavioural-correlates-combinatorial-versus-temporal-features-odour-codes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":83.486,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":83.486},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067963,"mean":6.0028158987782,"rank":50867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":5017093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067963,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157138,"mean":9.6635592635726,"rank":3153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":153985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157138,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8271,"mean":33.748333978235,"rank":902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8271,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":30.851724919094,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Ph.

Never be afraid to ask me questions. I may not have the answer, but I&rsquo;ll be damned if I haven&rsquo;t learned how to do a good, quick Google Scholar search to find out.\n\nIn addition I like to look at non-science related cute animal pictures, art and funny comics too :)\n\nHope you enjoy my blog but please, feel free to leave suggestions for improvement!"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https://twitter.com/jhewitt123/status/593222438995021824","posted_on":"2015-04-29T01:17:05+00:00","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3946543],"author":{"name":"John Hewitt USA","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2737016413/8de542c3ac790e42f76da3c4d99d4dd3_normal.jpeg","description":"Engineer, Neuroscientist, Speaker, Science Writer.  \nProgressive academics go away.  http://www.hewitt123.com/blog/?page_id=45  john@hewitt123.com","id_on_source":"jhewitt123","geo":{"lt":39.96066,"ln":-75.60549,"country":"US"},"followers":3117},"tweet_id":"593222438995021824"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=820255378029496&id=203745536347153","posted_on":"2015-05-06T13:32:37+00:00","license":"public","citation_ids":[3946543],"summary":"Locusts provide insight into brain response to stimuli, senses\n\nBy training a type of grasshopper to recognize odors, a team of biomedical engineers at Washington University in St. Louis is learning more about the brain and how it processes information fro","author":{"name":"Neuroscience Library/Bibliothèque des Neurosciences","url":"https://www.facebook.com/203745536347153","facebook_wall_name":"Neuroscience Library/Bibliothèque des Neurosciences","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/203745536347153/picture","id_on_source":"203745536347153"}},{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=979605225391569&id=479163965435700","posted_on":"2015-05-04T16:37:12+00:00","license":"public","citation_ids":[3946543],"summary":"Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis have trained locusts to recognize odors and, in the process, are learning more about how the brain responds to stimuli.
